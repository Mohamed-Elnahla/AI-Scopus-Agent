# AI-Scopus-Agent

This Streamlit web application, **AI-Scopus-Agent**, allows users to search for academic publications using the Scopus database and summarizes the results using the Llama-3-Groq language model. The app leverages the `scopus_search` tool to retrieve publications based on user-defined queries and provides detailed results along with a concise summary.

## Features

- **Advanced Scopus Search**: Construct queries using Scopus' advanced search syntax to find relevant academic publications.
- **Detailed Results**: View comprehensive details for each publication, including title, authors, journal, publication year, DOI, abstract, and direct links.
- **Summarization**: Receive a summarized overview of the search results generated by the Llama-3-Groq model.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interact with a simple and intuitive web interface powered by Streamlit.

## Prerequisites

Before running **AI-Scopus-Agent**, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **API Keys**:
  - **GROQ API Key**: Required to access the Llama-3-Groq model.
  - **Scopus API Key**: Required to access the Scopus API.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Elnahla/AI-Scopus-Agent.git
   cd AI-Scopus-Agent
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**

   Install all necessary packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note**: Since `langchain_core` and `langchain_groq` are specific to this implementation, ensure they are installed correctly. If they are not available on PyPI, you may need to install them from a private repository or source.

4. **Set Up API Keys**

   Create a `.streamlit` directory in the project folder:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .streamlit
   ```

   Inside the `.streamlit` directory, create a `secrets.toml` file:

   ```bash
   touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
   ```

   Add your API keys to `secrets.toml`:

   ```toml
   GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key"
   SCOPUS_API_KEY = "your_scopus_api_key"
   ```

   Replace `"your_groq_api_key"` and `"your_scopus_api_key"` with your actual API keys.

   **Security Notice**: Ensure that the `secrets.toml` file is kept secure and is not committed to any public repositories. Add `.streamlit/` to your `.gitignore` file.

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start **AI-Scopus-Agent** and open it in your default web browser.

## How to Use the App

1. **Enter Your Query**

   - In the text input field, enter your search query using Scopus' advanced search syntax.

2. **Execute the Search**

   - Click the **Search** button to execute the query.
   - The app will process your input, retrieve relevant publications, and display the detailed results.

3. **View Detailed Results**

   - The results include the title, authors, journal information, DOI with a direct link, abstract, and a link to the full text if available.

4. **Read the Summary**

   - Below the detailed results, the app provides a summarized overview of the search results generated by the Llama-3-Groq model.


## Dependencies

**AI-Scopus-Agent** relies on the following key libraries:

- **Streamlit**: For the web interface.
- **Requests**: To make HTTP requests to the Scopus API.
- **LangChain Core**: For handling the language model interactions.
- **LangChain Groq**: For integrating the Llama-3-Groq model.
- **Textwrap**: For formatting text.
- **JSON**: For handling JSON data.

Ensure all dependencies are installed and properly configured.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Errors**: If you encounter errors related to API keys, double-check that your keys are correctly set in the `secrets.toml` file and that they are valid.
- **Module Not Found**: If Python cannot find `langchain_core` or `langchain_groq`, ensure they are installed in your environment. You may need to install them from a private repository or source if they are not publicly available.
- **Network Issues**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection, as the app makes external API calls.
- **Unsupported Queries**: If your Scopus query returns no results or an error, verify that your query adheres to Scopus' search syntax guidelines.
